# T-CORE.FR_3D-Printing-Profiles
Here are the tailored profiles I use with Simplify3D and now PrusaSlicer.<br> üö®**Use at your own risk**üö®<br><br>
They're not flawless, but they'll give you a solid starting point for using Simplify3D, PrusaSlicer & Ultimaker Cura with a BQ Witbox 2, BQ Hephestos 2, FLSUN QQ-S PRO and (soon) FLSUN Prusa i3 C Plus 3D Printers.
<br><br>
‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE:** *These profiles are still a work in progress*‚ö†Ô∏è
<br><br><br>
Profiles are divided according to their printer. Available printers are:
* BQ Witbox 2 with cold bed (currently discontinued due to BQ's status : [BQ is DEAD](https://www.bq.com/))
* BQ Hephestos 2 with heated bed (currently discontinued due to BQ's status : [BQ is DEAD](https://www.bq.com/))
* FLSUN Prusa i3 C Plus with heated bed (Profiles coming soon)
* FLSUN QQ-S PRO with heated bed & the [Foxies CSTL Marlin version](https://github.com/Foxies-CSTL/Marlin_2.0.x/releases/)

<br>
Each printer section offers slicing profiles for Simplify3D & PrusaSlicer initially, and Octoprint & Ultimaker Cura afterward.

Finally, you will find profiles for different qualities and filaments.<br><br>

As you might imagine, working on this project takes a lot of time and effort. The maintenance, bug fixing, testing, release preparations, reviews of filaments, updates and such alone is already a huge undertaking, and that even leaves out other coding unrelated tasks like writing documentation, server administration etc.<br><br>
If this sounds like a full time job, that's because it is (almost). My full time work on this project is 100% crowd funded by people just like you!<br>
Your support keeps it going strong.

It's a simple share of all 3D printer profiles I use daily. Feedback is welcome!.<br>
**More profiles are on the horizon, especially with your help and support covering costs and resources. üëç**
