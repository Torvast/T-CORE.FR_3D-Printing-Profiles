# T-CORE.FR_3D-Printing-Profiles
Printing profiles for all my 3dprinters

**NOTE:** *These profiles are still a work in progress*

Profiles are divided according to their printer. Available printers are:
* BQ Witbox 2 with cold bed
* BQ Hephestos 2 with heated bed
* FLSUN Prusa i3 C Plus with heated bed


Within each printer you will find slicing profiles for Simplify3D in first time (Octoprint & Cura coming in second time).

Finally, you will find profiles for different qualities and filaments.
