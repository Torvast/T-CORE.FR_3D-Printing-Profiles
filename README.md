# T-CORE.FR_3D-Printing-Profiles
Printing profiles for all my 3dprinters

**NOTE:** *These profiles are still a work in progress*

Profiles are divided according to their printer. Available printers are:
* BQ Witbox 2 with cold bed
* BQ Hephestos 2 with heated bed
* FLSUN Prusa i3 C Plus with heated bed (Profiles coming soon)


Within each printer you will find slicing profiles **for Simplify3D & Ultimaker Cura in first time** (Octoprint in second time, and PrusaSlicer if i own a Prusa mk2/3 <3 ).

Finally, you will find profiles for different qualities and filaments.

**Support the project <3 : https://support-me.t-core.fr/ :**<br>
As you might imagine, working on this project takes a lot of time and effort. The maintenance, bug fixing, testing, release preparations, reviews of filaments, updates and such alone is already a huge undertaking, and that even leaves out other coding unrelated tasks like writing documentation, server administration etc.<br>
If this sounds like a full time job, that's because it is (almost). My full time work on this project is 100% crowd funded by people just like you!<br>
